# Afterword

## AI Alignment Course was amazing

This project marks the culmination of the [AI Safety Fundamentals: Alignmeent Course](https://aisafetyfundamentals.com/alignment/). Initially, I was uncertain about the course's relevance to my interests, but the comprehensive eight weeks of pre-reading and discussions, followed by four weeks of hands-on projects, profoundly expanded my understanding of AI alignment.

Before this course, I could not explain why  AI Safety Research required extensive computational resources. Now, I appreciate the complexity and necessity of these resources. The course provided a well-rounded perspective on technology, policy, and user experience concerning AI safety, including enlightening sessions on topics like [Consitutional AI](https://ar5iv.labs.arxiv.org/html/2212.08073)(RLAIF), [Weak-to-strong generalization](https://ar5iv.labs.arxiv.org/html/2312.09390), [Universal and Transferable Adversarial Attacks](https://llm-attacks.org/) and [Deep Forgetting](https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/mFAvspg4sXkrfZ7FA/deep-forgetting-and-unlearning-for-safely-scoped-llms).  

## LLM Safety for Youth 

The theme of "Evaluating LLM Safety for Youth" emerged from a desire to integrate intriguing concepts from the course with my background. Initially, I considered a project that would apply Japanese-specific cultural norms to "Constitutional AI" and rerun the reinforcement learning process. However, I realized that such a project would be too ambitious for a part-time endeavor.

Instead, I chose to focus on evaluating LLMs for youth because:
- Recent technologies have had significant, sometimes negative impacts on this demographic, as noted in the overview section.
- Evaluations are a critical component of AI alignment, exemplified by concepts like Deep Forgetting, and I wanted to engage deeply with this process.

This project also rekindled my engagement with GitHub after over a decade, and I ventured into writing code in Google Collab and Apps Script, calling various APIs.
