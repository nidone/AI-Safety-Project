title: Afterword - AI Safety Project

# Afterword (WIP)

A few ideas to incorporate
- The course was helpful.
- Initially wanted do something around the latest topics I learned in the course, such as Constitutional AI and Weak to Strong Generalization.
- For Constitutional AI, wanted to x. For Weak to Strong Generalization, wanted to Y.
- But thaks to the course, I was able to tell it is technically too involved to do it part-time.
- All stuff includes Eval, so I decided to do this project.
- Acknowledgement
