# Afterword

## AI Alignment Course was amazing
- This project is end-of-course porject of [AI Safety Fundamentals: Alignmeent Course](https://aisafetyfundamentals.com/alignment/). When I signed up, I was not really sure if this will be useful. But from 8 weeks of pre-reading and disucssoins, and 4 weeks of project, I have learned tons about AI alignment. 
- Before this course, I was not really sure why AI Safety Research requires that amount of compute resource. But not it is very clear to me. Course offered very balanced view of Technology, Policy and User Experience around AI Safety.
- I particulary liked session on [Consitutional AI](https://ar5iv.labs.arxiv.org/html/2212.08073)(RLAIF), [Weak-to-strong generalization](https://ar5iv.labs.arxiv.org/html/2312.09390), [Universal and Transferable Adversarial Attacks](https://llm-attacks.org/) and [Deep Forgetting](https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/mFAvspg4sXkrfZ7FA/deep-forgetting-and-unlearning-for-safely-scoped-llms).  

## LLM for Youth 

- I initially wanted to work on the project that combines (i) some of the most intereseting concept I learned and (ii) my background as a Japanese. For example, what if I added some Japanese-specific cultural norm to "Consitution" and re-run Reinformcement Learning process? But I quickly learned it would be too time-consuming for a partitme project.
- I picked up my theme of "Evaluating LLM for Youth" because: 
  - I have seen a few occasion the latest technology negatively affected on this demography, as I wrote in overview section. 
  - Through the course I understand Eval is such a core part of AI Alignment (as in Deep Forgetting) and watned to go through the actual process. 
- It was also a good opporutnity to use my GitHub account for the first time in 10+ years, and write some code on Google COllab and AppScript, calling various APIs.  

## Acknowledgement

- Thanks for the moderator and cohort memebers of the cohort I attended, #16, #19, #20, #22 and #24, especially [Jacob Heimes](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jacob-haimes/) and [Ahmed Ghoor](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ahmedghoor/)
- Thanks for [Digital Agency, the Japan Govenment](https://www.linkedin.com/company/digital-agency-of-japan/). Without affliation with you back in April 2024, I might not have been admitted to the course in the first place.
