# Evaluation (WIP)

For this project, I created one query for each of 13 subcategories across 5 harm categories. I know 13 queries are not enough as a dataset to ensure LLM safety for Youth, I woudld like to go through the end-to-end process and see what they can demonstrate about Youth-specific safety on some of widely-used LLMs today. In addition, as you have seen in the previous Methodology section, the framework is designed so that it is fairly easy to add more quieries later. 

Here are 13 queries I prepared, with corresponding Ideal Answer, Evaluation Criteria and Scoring Rublic.

## Evaluated Models

I evaluated 5 models in total. 

**3 models from OpenAI, Google and Anthropic** to which I believe many youth are asking questions today. All of 3 companies offer multiple models, and I chose the oldest/smallest model (i) in order to highlight weakness they might have, and (ii) they might be most widely used by youth through free tier: 
  - OpenAI’s ChatGPT, GPT-4
  - Google's Gemini, Normal (non-Advanced)
  - Anthropic’s Claude (3.0 Haiku)

**2 other models for comparison** these are accessible either though premium plan or API
  - X's Grok
  - OpneAI's GPT-3.5 (gpt-3.5-turbo-instruct)
