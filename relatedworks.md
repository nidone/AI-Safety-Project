While there is extensive research on "AI Safety" and the "Technological Impact on Children’s Cognitive and Emotional Growth" across various disciplines, studies that combine these aspects with a data-driven or quantitative approach are scarce. Below, I highlight some pivotal research efforts:

- **LLM Evaluation Efforts**:  
  [HELM](https://crfm.stanford.edu/helm/classic/latest/) (Holistic Evaluation of Language Models) offers a comprehensive framework that assessed 30 prominent models over 42 scenarios across 7 metrics. While these evaluations cover various domains, isolating results specifically for children remains challenging, indicating a gap in targeted evaluations for this demographic.

- **AI Ethics for Children**:  
  Emerging research in this area includes UNICEF’s [Policy Guidance on AI for Children](https://www.unicef.org/reports/policy-guidance-ai-children) (November 2021), which advocates for AI systems that account for children’s emotional well-being and developmental stages.

- **AI in Education**:  
  The US Department of Education's [report on AI's role in education](http://department) (May 2023) emphasizes AI’s supportive role alongside educators and warns of risks like algorithmic biases. The UK Department of Education also issued [policy paper on Generative AI on Eduaction](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/generative-artificial-intelligence-in-education/generative-artificial-intelligence-ai-in-education) (October 2023). Another perspective, [Speculative Futures on ChatGPT](https://researchers.cdu.edu.au/en/publications/speculative-futures-on-chatgpt-and-generative-artificial-intellig) (March 2023), speculates on AI’s broader implications for educational practices.

- **Child-Robot Interaction (CRI)**:  
  Studies such as [The Effects of Social Presence and Familiarity on Children–Robot Interactions](https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/23/9/4231) explore how children's interactions with AI-driven robots might affect their social and emotional skills, suggesting potential developmental implications.

- **Advisory on AI Products**:  
  Common Sense Media's [AI Rating Framework](https://www.commonsensemedia.org/aiframework) (September 2023) rates AI products like ChatGPT and Stability AI, focusing on criteria such as human-centered design and fairness. This seems getting traction - for instance UK's leading charity [NSPCC partnered with Common Sense Media](https://www.nspcc.org.uk/about-us/news-opinion/2024/2024-01-25-new-partnership-as-young-people-contact-childline-about-ai-related-sexual-abuse-bullying-and-misinformation/) (January 2024) 

Despite these contributions, the lack of long-term studies specifically focusing on the effects of continuous LLM interaction on children’s emotional intelligence, empathy, and cognitive abilities remains a significant research gap. This project aims to initiate a dialogue and lay groundwork for future studies that develop safeguards tailored specifically for young users.
