title: Conclusions - AI Safety Project

# Conclusinos

- Argued the importance of LLM Safety for Youth, and run small eval in the way that can be (hopefully) easily scaled and automated.
- Amount of data is small, but it still implies (i) huge progress the industry has made in the past few years, and (ii) some remaining work for future.

## Discussions

- I did best-effort research for development pshychology. But I'm cerntainly not expert. I reached out to a few experts at Stanford, Yale and Harvard. But my work is still nascent to justify energy and term of those expert.  
- I mostly tested reactive Chat-based LLM. More work could be necessarily for Agentic AI

## Future Work

- More contribution from developmental phychology area.
- Add more queries
- Run automated eval process.
