## Past Researches

There are various existing studies on "AI Safety" and "Technologies’ impact on children’s cognitive and emotional growth" across multiple fields. However, there seems to be limited data-driven or quantitative studies at the intersection of these topics. Below are some key research efforts:

- **LLM Evaluation Efforts**:  
  [HELM](https://crfm.stanford.edu/helm/classic/latest/) (Holistic Evaluation of Language Models) is a comprehensive framework for evaluating language models. It originally assessed 30 prominent models over 42 scenarios across 7 metrics. Scenarios are categorized by task, domain, and language, with domains further subdivided into text properties (what), speaker (who), and time (when). While “who” could include children, it’s difficult to isolate results specifically for this demographic.

- **AI Ethics for Children**:  
  Research in this area is emerging, with few comprehensive studies. However, UNICEF published [Policy Guidance on AI for Children](https://www.unicef.org/reports/policy-guidance-ai-children) in November 2021, encouraging AI systems that consider children's emotional well-being, development, and worldviews.

- **AI in Education**:  
  The US Department of Education released [a report on AI's role in education](http://department) (May 2023), advising that AI should prioritize trust and work alongside educators. The report highlights potential risks, such as algorithmic biases and dependency on technology. Additionally, [Speculative Futures on ChatGPT](https://researchers.cdu.edu.au/en/publications/speculative-futures-on-chatgpt-and-generative-artificial-intellig) (March 2023) reflects on the potential implications for education.

- **Child-Robot Interaction (CRI)**:  
  This field explores children's interactions with AI-driven robots. [The Effects of Social Presence and Familiarity on Children–Robot Interactions](https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/23/9/4231) discuss how over-reliance on robots may hinder emotional and social skill development in human contexts.

- **Advisory on AI Products**:  
  Common Sense Media's [AI Rating Framework](https://www.commonsensemedia.org/aiframework) (September 2023) evaluates [major AI products](https://www.commonsensemedia.org/ai). ChatGPT is rated "Moderate Risk," and Stability AI as "High Risk." Their criteria focus on human-centered design, fairness, and promoting learning.

Overall, there's a lack of **long-term studies** on how continuous interaction with LLMs might affect children’s emotional intelligence, empathy, and cognitive abilities. More research is needed to **develop safeguards tailored specifically for young users**.
