# AI-Safety-Project

This project is part of my final work for [the AI Safety Fundamentals: AI Alignment Course](https://aisafetyfundamentals.com/alignment/). You can find [Github Page here](https://nidone.github.io/AI-Safety-Project/). 

## LLM Safety for Youth

I chose this topic because I believe it addresses an important, under-researched issue. Additionally, it allows me to apply some of the technical approaches Iâ€™ve learned during the course, as well as gaining hands-on knowledge of AI Eval work myself. 

## Feedback appreciated!

From typo to complete misunderstanding of approaches.
